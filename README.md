# Skylda's Flipper Zero Online Vault

This is pretty much where I am keeping an online vault of my edits and changes
to anything I do on the Flipper Zero. As my time is limited to dedicate to
the Flipper Zero, what little I do will be reflected here.

Currently I like to make SubGHZ Remotes, to make flipping through saved files easier
upon execution time.

If you use these in your projects, all I ask is a link back here in your github,
or this github link in your attributions sections.


## Installation

It's as easy as retaining file structure on ext.

Just copy over to your SD card, and reboot the flipper.

You should find my remotes in SubGHZ Remote menu option.

Playlists are found under Applications, Tools, SubGHZ Playlists.
